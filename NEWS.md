# multiomeR 0.4.1.9000

- Made manuscript benchmark wall-time results portable across targets stores
  and removed machine-specific figure paths ([#4](https://github.com/koefoeden/multiomeR/pull/4)).

- Replaced Seurat-backed cell-cycle module scoring with BPCells-native control-binned scoring, restored BPCells-native UCell marker scoring for signed marker sets, and added synthetic parity validation against Seurat and UCell reference implementations.

Initial public beta snapshot.
